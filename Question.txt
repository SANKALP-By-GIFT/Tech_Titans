Server state vs client state separation

Context-based state management

Routing architecture

Form validation patterns

Rendering optimization

Clean component composition

🎯 SECTION A — CORE REQUIREMENTS (70 Marks)
1️⃣ Product Listing Page (20 Marks)
Route
/products

Functional Requirements

Display a list of products fetched from a mock API.

Each product card must include:

Product image

Title

Price

Rating

“View Details” button

“Add to Cart” button

Technical Requirements

Fetch products using React Query

Endpoint:

GET /products


Handle:

Loading state

Error state

Empty state

Use reusable ProductCard component

Add basic category filter (optional bonus)

2️⃣ Product Details Page (Nested Route) (10 Marks)
Route
/products/:productId

Functional Requirements

Display:

Full product description

Price

Stock status

Add to Cart button

Technical Requirements

Use useParams

Fetch single product using React Query:

GET /products/:id


Ensure caching works properly

3️⃣ Cart Management (Context API) (20 Marks)
Functional Requirements

Add product to cart

Remove product from cart

Increase / decrease quantity

Display cart summary:

Subtotal

Total items

Total price

Technical Requirements

Create CartContext

Create custom hook:

useCart()


Cart must be global state

Derived values (total price) must NOT be stored directly — calculate dynamically

Explain in comments:

Difference between client state (cart) and server state (products)

4️⃣ Checkout Form (15 Marks)
Route
/checkout

Form Fields

Full Name

Email

Address

Payment Method (Dropdown)

Validation Requirements

Use React Hook Form

Use Yup validation

Disable submit if invalid

Show inline error messages

On Submit:

Simulate successful order

Clear cart

Redirect to success page

5️⃣ React Query Server State Handling (5 Marks)

You must:

Use useQuery for products

Use useMutation for checkout simulation

Demonstrate cache invalidation or refetching
